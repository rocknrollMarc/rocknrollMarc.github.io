<blockquote><p>Textmate/Coda/etc. are like the automatic transmission Volkswagen Jetta of text<br/>editors. The VW Jetta has just enough horsepower for daily tasks, some<br/>flexibility, but most of all it’s easy enough for most drivers to jump into and<br/>drive away.  Vim is like the manual transmission Lamborghini Aventador—the<br/>pinnacle of supercars. You can’t just jump into the Aventador and drive away,<br/>you have to learn how to control the 700hp, 6.5 liter V12 engine—quite a<br/>powerful beast. Learn the intricacies of the clutch, get used to the touch<br/>sensitive carbon-ceramic brakes. The tight steering and low suspension are a<br/>hell of a change from a VW Jetta.</p><footer><strong>Source</strong> <cite><a href='http://robots.thoughtbot.com/taming-a-supercar'>Taming a Supercar</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
